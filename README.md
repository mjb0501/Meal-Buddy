See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and filenames include hashes. Your app is now ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**\
If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, `eject` will remove the single build dependency from your project, copying configuration files and dependencies (e.g., webpack, Babel, ESLint) directly into your project for more control.
